# Travel speed and routes of the bike-share system: An analysis of Bike Share Toronto

This project was a part of [GGRC32](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/ggrc32h3), an essential spatial analysis course taught by [Dr. Christopher D. Higgins](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/geography/christopher-higgins) in Winter 2023. It examined the Bike Share Toronto system and used the R5 routing engine to address the following two research questions.
-	RQ1. What are the travel speeds of cyclists in the Bikeshare Toronto System?
-	RQ2. To what extent do the existing bike lanes complement the Bikeshare Toronto System?
